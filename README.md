### Worker Architecture

PriceTracker uses a decoupled microservices architecture with separate worker services:

- **Web Service**: Next.js application handling UI, APIs, and user interactions
- **Python Worker**: Dedicated service for executing Python-based scrapers
- **TypeScript Worker**: Dedicated service for TypeScript/Crawlee scrapers
- **TypeScript Utility Worker**: Handles integrations, data processing, and utility tasks

**Benefits:**
- **Reliability**: Isolated failure domains prevent scraper issues from affecting the web app
- **Scalability**: Workers can be scaled independently based on workload
- **Performance**: Resource-intensive tasks don't impact user experience
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and specialized services

For detailed architecture documentation, see [worker-architecture.md](./docs/architecture/worker-architecture.md).
